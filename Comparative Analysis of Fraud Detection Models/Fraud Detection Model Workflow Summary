## Fraud Detection Model Workflow Summary

1. **Import Libraries**
   - `pandas` for data handling.
   - `numpy` for numerical operations.
   - `sklearn` for machine learning tools.
   - `matplotlib` for data visualization.

2. **Load Dataset**
   - Data is loaded from a remote URL using `pandas.read_csv`.

3. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Initial examination using `data.head()` and `data.tail()` to understand dataset structure.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Features (`X`) and target variable (`y`) are defined.
   - `fraud` column is the target, while others are features.

5. **Data Splitting**
   - Dataset is split into training and test sets.
   - `train_test_split` is used, with a test size of 20%.

6. **Model Initialization**
   - Decision Tree Classifier initialized with a maximum depth of 3.
   - Limits complexity and overfitting of the model.

7. **Model Training**
   - Model is trained using the training set (`X_train`, `y_train`).

8. **Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Model predictions made on the test set.
   - Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

9. **Visualization**
   - Decision tree visualized using `matplotlib` and `sklearn.tree.plot_tree`.
   - Helps in understanding the decision-making process of the model.
